📈 Key Analysis & Visualizations
Null Value Analysis: Checked for missing values and understood where data cleaning might be required.

Distribution Plots: Histograms for features like lead_time, adr (average daily rate), and number_of_nights to understand booking behaviors.

Categorical Analysis: Count plots and pie charts for categorical variables such as hotel, meal, market_segment, customer_type, and is_canceled.

Heatmap: Correlation matrix heatmap to understand relationships between numerical features.

Seasonality & Trends: Time series trends in bookings by month and year.

Cancellation Analysis: Explored what factors most influence booking cancellations.

📌 Insights
City hotels have higher booking volume but also a higher cancellation rate.

Longer lead times tend to correlate with higher cancellation likelihood.

Family bookings tend to be more frequent during vacation months (June–August).

Market segment and distribution channel influence booking confirmation rate.
